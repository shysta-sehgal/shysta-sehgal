- 👋 Hi, I’m @shysta-sehgal
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and computationally modelling higher mental processes in human cognition.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about reinforcement learning tasks in surgical robots and developing neural networks that simulate human reading behaviour. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the field of robotics and deep learning.
